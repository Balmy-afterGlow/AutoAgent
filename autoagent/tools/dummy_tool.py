    [This is a dummy tool, it's used for demonstrating the usage of the autoagent, you should write your own tool instead of using this dummy tool, and the following docstring is just a template, you should modify it to fit your own tool.]
    The tool is used to ...

    Args:
        args1: ...
        args2: ...
        ...
    Returns:
        ...
    Notes:
        The return value can be a string, an agent, or an instance of Result.
    1. The most common return value is a string, but the length of the string should not be too long, and you can save the result to a file if the length is too long.
    2. If the tool is used to transfer the conversation context to an agent, you can return an instance of Agent, like:
    ```python
    sales_agent = Agent(name="sales_agent", instructions="You are a sales agent.")
    def transfer_to_sales_agent():
        return sales_agent
    ```
    3. If there is some complex operations inside the tool, you can return an instance of Result, for example, you should modify the context variables in the result.
    ```python
    def sales_agent_tool(recommendation: str, context_variables: dict):
        '''
        The tool is used to recommend products to the user.
        '''
        context_variables["recommendation"] = recommendation
        return Result(value="I recommend the product: " + recommendation, agent=user_agent, context_variables=context_variables)

    4. The value of Result class should be a string, if you want to return a json dictionary, you should convert it to string by json.dumps(result)
    ```
    5. The tools should be created in the python file in the `autoagent/autoagent/tools` folder.
    """
    ...  # the implementation of the tool
    return "..."  # the return value of the tool.
